# Hi, I'm Yash 👋

I'm an undergraduate student pursuing B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.  
Currently learning Java, DSA, and building projects that actually solve problems.

### 🌱 Interests

- Clean, purposeful code

Most of my work lives in private repos (for now), but I’m slowly moving public-facing ones here.  
What’s visible is always maintained with purpose.
